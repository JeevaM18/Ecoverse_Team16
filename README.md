# 🛡️ SafeMotion – AI-Driven Activity Monitoring & Safety Intelligence Platform

SafeMotion is a unified AI-powered activity monitoring platform designed for elderly care, workplace safety, and rehabilitation monitoring.

It combines human activity recognition, risk analytics, predictive models, and real-time alerts into a single, modular system backed by Firebase and ML inference pipelines.  
The platform interprets the same motion data differently based on user context (Elderly, Employee, Rehab), enabling healthcare intelligence and safety compliance using one scalable backend.

---

## 🚀 Key Highlights

- 🔹 Context-aware activity interpretation (Elderly / Workplace / Rehab)
- 🔹 Motion Biography & Baseline Drift analysis
- 🔹 AI-based fall risk & safety scoring
- 🔹 Real-time caregiver & supervisor alerts
- 🔹 Rehabilitation Status Index (RSI) prediction
- 🔹 Firebase-backed real-time data storage
- 🔹 Modular backend architecture (ML + rules + analytics)
- 🔹 Dashboard-ready outputs for enterprise UI

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Detect and analyze human activities from motion data  
- Monitor elderly mobility decline & fall risk  
- Track baseline drift in daily activity patterns  
- Generate caregiver alerts with severity & recommendations  
- Enforce workplace safety & access compliance  
- Predict rehabilitation recovery status  
- Centralize all outputs in Firebase for real-time dashboards
